Logistic Regression Model for Iris Species Classification
This project implements a Logistic Regression model to classify species from the famous Iris dataset. The dataset consists of 150 samples from three species
of Iris flowers: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. The features used for classification are sepal length, sepal width, petal length,
and petal width.

Workflow:
Data Preprocessing: The Iris dataset is loaded and split into feature variables (sepal and petal measurements) and target labels (species). 
The target labels are encoded using LabelEncoder for use in the Logistic Regression model.
Training and Testing Split: The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using the train_test_split function from Scikit-learn.
Model Training: A Logistic Regression model is trained using the training data. The model's performance is evaluated on both the training and testing sets.
Evaluation: The model's accuracy is calculated, and the F1-score, precision, recall, and confusion matrix are used to assess performance on the classification
task. The model achieves an accuracy of 96.67% on the training set and 93.33% on the test set.
Visualization: Heatmaps of the confusion matrix for both the training and test sets are generated using Seaborn to visually
represent the model's classification performance.
Key Technologies:
Python
Pandas for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for model building, evaluation, and splitting data
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
This project demonstrates how Logistic Regression can be applied to a multi-class classification problem, providing valuable insights into the 
relationship between the features of the Iris dataset and species classification. The model is simple yet effective for educational purposes and serves as a
foundation for more complex 
classification algorithms.
