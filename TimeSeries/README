Time Series Analysis of Daily Maximum Temperatures Using ARIMA and SARIMA Models

This project focuses on time series analysis and forecasting of daily maximum temperatures using the ARIMA and SARIMA models. 
The dataset contains temperature records from January 1, 1981, to December 31, 1990. The goal is to analyze historical temperature data, test for stationarity,
and build models to forecast future temperatures.

The workflow begins with loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, followed by data visualization to understand the time series trends.
Monthly averages of daily temperatures are calculated and visualized to identify patterns in the data. Seasonal decomposition is applied to the data to
separate it into trend, seasonal, and residual components, providing insights into the underlying structure of the temperature variations.

A stationarity test using the Dickey-Fuller test is conducted to check if the data is stationary, a requirement for time series modeling. 
The test indicates that the raw data is non-stationary, and differencing is applied to achieve stationarity. Various transformations, such as logarithmic 
and square root transformations, are explored to further stabilize the variance in the data.

The ARIMA model is applied to the training data, with the best-fit model chosen based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). 
The SARIMA model is also explored, which incorporates both seasonal and non-seasonal elements to better capture periodic patterns in the temperature data.

The accuracy of the models is evaluated using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and predictions are made for the test set.
Both ARIMA and SARIMA models are used to forecast future temperatures beyond the dataset range, providing insights into temperature trends for the next year.

Key technologies used include Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data handling and visualization, as well as Statsmodels for implementing
the ARIMA and SARIMA models. The project demonstrates how to apply advanced time series modeling techniques to real-world data for forecasting future trends.
