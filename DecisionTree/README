Diabetes Prediction Using Decision Tree Classifier
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on several medical attributes using a Decision Tree Classifier.
The dataset used for this analysis is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle, which contains various medical 
records for 768 patients, with each record classified as either diabetic (1) or non-diabetic (0).

The features used in this model include:

Pregnancies
Glucose levels
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin levels
BMI
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age
Project Workflow:
Data Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and the features are selected for training the model. The dataset is
then split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Model Training: A Decision Tree Classifier is built using the training data. The model is trained using the Gini Index as the splitting
criterion and a maximum depth of 3 for the tree.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy on both the training and testing sets. The accuracy of the model on the training data 
is 76.35%, and the accuracy on the test data is 75.76%.

Feature Importance and Visualization: The decision tree model identifies the most important features that contribute to predicting diabetes, and the trained 
tree is visualized using Graphviz.

Technologies Used:
Python: For coding and model implementation.
Scikit-Learn: For building the Decision Tree Classifier and model evaluation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Graphviz and Pydotplus: For visualizing the decision tree structure.
This project provides an easy-to-understand example of how decision trees can be used to classify medical conditions based on patient data. 
It is a useful model for understanding the relationships between different medical attributes and the likelihood of diabetes.
