Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Iris Species Classification
This project applies a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify species in the famous Iris dataset. The dataset contains 150 samples from
three Iris species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. Each sample is described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, 
and petal width.

The workflow starts with loading the Iris dataset, which is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function, with 80% of the data
used for training and 20% for testing. The goal is to classify the species of the Iris flower based on the provided features.

The first model is built using the linear kernel in the SVM algorithm. After training the model, the performance is evaluated using the confusion matrix 
and the classification report. The linear kernel SVM achieves an accuracy of 98.67%, with a perfect classification across all species in the test set,
as shown by a 100% precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

The project also explores other kernel functions, such as the radial basis function (rbf) and the sigmoid kernel, comparing their performance with the
linear kernel. Visualizations of the dataset are generated using Seabornâ€™s pairplot, which highlights the separability of the species based on petal and 
sepal measurements.

In this project, Scikit-learn is used for the SVM implementation and model evaluation, while Pandas is employed for data handling. Seaborn and Matplotlib 
are utilized for visualizing the dataset and performance metrics.

The project provides a clear demonstration of how SVM can effectively handle multi-class classification tasks such as the Iris dataset, achieving high
accuracy and providing interpretable visualizations.
