Random Forest Regression for Boston Housing Price Prediction
This project focuses on using a Random Forest Regressor to predict housing prices based on various features from the Boston Housing Dataset. 
The goal of this analysis is to build a robust model that predicts the price of homes in the Boston area based on features like crime rate, 
number of rooms, and access to highways, among others.

The project begins by loading the Boston Housing dataset, which contains 13 features influencing housing prices. The features include crime rates, 
residential land zoning, property tax rate, and more. The target variable is the median price of homes in thousands of dollars.

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function, with 70% of the data used for training and 30% for testing. 
A Random Forest Regressor with 300 estimators (trees) is then trained on the training set. The model's performance is evaluated 
using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared scores. On the training set, the model achieves a MSE of 1.59 and an R-squared score of 0.98,
indicating strong predictive performance. On the test set, the model achieves a MSE of 13.13 and an R-squared score of 0.83, showing that the model generalizes
well to unseen data.

The feature importances are also calculated to determine which variables have the most influence on housing prices. The number of rooms per dwelling and the
percentage of lower-status population appear to be the most significant factors in predicting housing prices.

The project is implemented using Python and key libraries such as Scikit-learn for model building, Pandas for data handling, and NumPy for numerical operations.

This analysis provides a clear example of how Random Forest regression can be applied to predict continuous values, such as housing prices, based on multiple 
input features.
The model's high performance demonstrates its utility in handling complex datasets with nonlinear relationships.
