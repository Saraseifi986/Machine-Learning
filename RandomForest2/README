Random Forest Classifier for Iris Species Classification
This project implements a Random Forest Classifier to classify the species of the Iris flower dataset, one of the most popular datasets in machine learning.
The dataset consists of 150 samples, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable 
is the species of the iris flower,
which can be one of three classes: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, or Iris-virginica.

The project begins by loading the dataset and transforming it into a Pandas DataFrame. The feature variables include the measurements of the sepals and petals, 
while the target variable represents the flower species. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets using train_test_split, with 70% of the data
used
for training and 30% for testing.

The Random Forest Classifier is trained on the training data, using 200 decision trees (n_estimators=200) and the Gini impurity criterion for splitting.
The classifier's performance is evaluated on both the training and test sets, with the model achieving an accuracy of 96.19% on the training set and 97.78% on
the test set, demonstrating strong predictive performance.

Feature importance is calculated to determine which variables are most significant in predicting the species of the iris flower. The results show that petal 
length and petal width are the most important features for classification, which aligns with previous studies of the dataset.

The project is implemented using Python and key libraries such as Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib
and Seaborn for visualizing the data and model results.

This analysis provides a clear and straightforward implementation of the Random Forest Classifier, showcasing its effectiveness in handling multi-class
classification tasks like the Iris dataset. With its high accuracy and explainable feature importance, the model serves as a strong example of how ensemble
methods can be used for reliable classification.
