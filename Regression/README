Regression Model for Sales Prediction Using Advertising Data
This project aims to predict sales based on advertising spend across three channels: TV, radio, and newspaper. Using Python and the Scikit-Learn library, 
multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso, are applied to explore the relationships between advertising expenditure and sales,
and to build predictive models.

The dataset contains 200 rows with four columns: TV, radio, newspaper (advertising spend in each channel), and sales (dependent variable). 
The project implements polynomial feature generation to explore higher-order relationships and compares the performance of different models.

Key steps in the analysis include:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, and features are prepared for model training.
Model Training: Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso models are trained using the advertising data.
Evaluation Metrics: Models are evaluated using R-squared and mean absolute error on both the training and testing sets to assess performance.
The results demonstrate that the sixth-degree polynomial regression model achieves the best performance, with an R-squared value of 0.9986 on the training set
and a mean absolute error of 0.5 on the test set.

Technologies used include Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib for model training, evaluation, and data visualization. The project offers insights
into the effectiveness of advertising spend on sales and provides a robust predictive model for future sales predictions.
