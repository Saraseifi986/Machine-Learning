# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects Repository



This repository showcases a collection of data science and machine learning projects, focusing on various analytical techniques, algorithms, and real-world problem-solving. It includes work on classification, regression, time series analysis, and predictive modeling. Some of the featured projects include a Business Postpaid Mobile Accounts Risk Analysis, where customer activation rates and credit risk are evaluated to identify revenue opportunities. The Sales Prediction Project uses regression models to predict sales based on advertising spend across TV, radio, and newspaper channels. The Diabetes Prediction Project employs a decision tree classifier to assess the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical data. Additionally, the Iris Species Classification Project and Time Series Analysis of Daily Temperatures highlight advanced machine learning and forecasting techniques using algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, ARIMA, and SARIMA.

This repository demonstrates my proficiency in building and applying machine learning models, data preprocessing, and using Python libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Statsmodels to generate actionable insights and predictive models across a range of datasets and industries.
